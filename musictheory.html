	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Music Theory</p>

	<p>To understand music theory we first have to understand that:</p>

	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2em;"><strong>✨ Music is just nice sounds. ✨</strong></p>

	<p>Everything in music essentially comes back to the fact that music sounds good. No matter how complicated it may seem, music is about creativity and feeling. If it sounds good, you’re doing something right.</p>
	
<p>This leads into the first proper lesson.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">


<p id="sound" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Sound & Pitch</p>

<p>Sound is made of waves through the air.</p>

	<p>The speed of the wave makes the sound higher or lower. We measure this by the amount of waves per second or “frequency.” This unit of measurement is called <strong>“Hertz”</strong> (hz).</p>

<img src="images/wave.jpg" alt="Wave" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


 <p>We call this <strong>“Pitch”</strong> and for music we have named 12 of these pitches. Despite there being a wide range of frequency we can hear, there is no need to name any more pitches. To explain this further we’ll look at “A”.</p>

 <p>The pitch we hear at 440hz has been called “A.”</p>

 <p>If you divide that by 2 to 220hz our brains also hear “A.”</p>

 <p>So too if you keep halving. So 110hz = “A”, 55hz = “A” and so on.</p>

 <p>This also works when doubling. 880hz = “A”, 1760hz = “A” and so on.</p>

<img src="images/doubling.jpg" alt="doubling" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">
 

<p>So there is no reason to name any more pitches because to our ears they loop back around to the beginning.</p>

<p>The distance between each of these loops is called an <strong>“Octave”</strong> which we have divided into 12 and named these divisions <strong>“Notes”</strong>. The naming system of the notes will be explained over the next few lessons.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="notes" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Notes</p>

 <p>The pitches we learned about previously are more commonly known as <strong>“notes.”</strong> There are 12 notes in total. 7 <strong>natural</strong> notes and 5 <strong>accidentals</strong> (The ones with the # and ♭). This is where the first bit of memorisation comes in.</p> 

<img src="images/notes.jpg" alt="notes" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


<p>Each of these notes are the same distance from each other. I will be referring to this distance as a <strong>“half step.”</strong></p> 

<p>You’ll notice that some of the notes have 2 names; these are commonly referred to as the <strong>“sharps”</strong> (#) or <strong>“flats”</strong> (♭). It should be noted that there is nothing special or different about these notes. Sharp means up a half step, and flat means down a half step.</p>

<img src="images/flatsharp1.jpg" alt="flatsharp1" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Also</p>

<img src="images/flatsharp2.jpg" alt="flatsharp2" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


 <p>It’s simply a naming system to help us not have the same letter notes in our scales.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="scales" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Scales</p> 

<p>It’s not the notes themselves that sound musical, but rather the distance between them. All 12 notes played in sequence (The chromatic scale) doesn’t really make you feel much. So we made more scales with different spacings that have different feelings. We will focus on just 1 for now:</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">The Major scale</p>

 <p>Now we are starting to skip notes. I will be referring to this as a <strong>“whole step”.</strong></p>

<img src="images/wholestep.jpg" alt="wholestep" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

 <p>As said before, <strong>scales are not the notes, they are the steps between them.</strong></p>
</p>So (more memorisation here) the major scale steps are: Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, and a half step brings us back to the start.</p>

<img src="images/majorscale.jpg" alt="majorscale" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

 <p>You can start this combination of steps on any note and, while it will sound higher or lower, everything else will sound the same.</p>

<img src="images/maj3.jpg" alt="maj3" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>I’d encourage you to experiment with this on your instrument. It’s important to see and hear how this works in practice.</p>

<p>Once you're happy with that it's time to be able to name the notes properly. The naming system will be fully explained in the next section.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="keys" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Keys</p>

<p>When you play a scale the key is named after the starting note and the scale. For example a major scale played starting on A is called A major.</p>

<p>The names of the notes in the key should then follow the A through G format. Whatever key you're playing in should never have 2 of the same letter. This is what decides the name to give our accidentals.</p>

<img src="images/aacc.jpg" alt="aacc" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>There’s an important pattern emerging here. Your key will only have sharps or flats, not both. Also, each key has a different number of accidentals.</p>

<p>When starting your key on an accidental you can choose to call it one or the other, however one is usually less complicated than the other.</p>

<img src="images/abcomp.jpg" alt="abcomp" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>While they are both correct, G# doesn't need to be doing all that. Lets just call that one A♭ and forget about it.</p>

<p> We can then use the number of accidentals to help learn the different keys to play in. This is the reason most music theory lessons start with the key of C major, as it contains no accidentals. I will also be using it in future lessons.</p>

<img src="images/cmaj.jpg" alt="cmaj" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="numeric" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">The Numeric System</p>

<p>Now that we have learned that all our major scales roughly sound the same, we need a system to talk about the notes that can apply to all  keys and by assigning a number instead of a note in between our whole steps and half steps, we can do just that.</p>

<img src="images/numeric.jpg" alt="numeric" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Notice that there are two 1’s. Just like how our notes loop, so do the numbers.</p>

<p>Now I’d encourage you to experiment with this system on your instrument. Make some random number patterns from 1-7 and play them in different keys if you can. (Don’t work too hard)</p>
 
<p>625761. 5463112. 35215545 and so on.</p>

<p>You’ll again notice that while higher or lower, they all sound the same.</p>

<p>Also by making random number patterns, you’re starting to get creative, and hopefully you’ll notice that even with that little bit of creativity things are starting to sound more ✨musical✨</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="minor" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">The Minor Scale</p>

<p>It’s time to learn our next scale. The minor scale. Like any other scale it's got its own set of whole and half steps. This time (memorisation time) it's: Whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole.</p>

<img src="images/minorsteps.jpg" alt="minorsteps" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


<p>This works just like the major scale. You can:</p>

<p> - Start this set of whole and half steps to any note and it will sound the same.</p>
<p> - Name the sharps and flats from A to G with no double letters.</p>
<p> - Assign numerical values to play in different keys.</p>

<p>Now let’s compare the 2 scales. You may recall when I said that different scales have different feelings. It’s often stated that the major scale sounds “happy” and the minor sounds “sad.”</p>

<p>Also like keys, each minor key has different numbers of accidentals. Just like the key of C major, the first minor scale taught is A minor as it has no sharps or flats.</p>

<img src="images/aminor.jpg" alt="aminor" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">
 
<p>Wait a second… Why does A minor have the same notes as C major?</p>

<p>Let’s find out.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="relative" style="text-align:center; font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">Relative Minors</p>

<p>Every major scale has its relative minor. This means that they share the same notes and chords.</p>

<img src="images/cna.jpg" alt="cna" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>It's not just C major and A minor that have this relationship. Remember that every major scale has the same order of steps and so does every minor scale.</p>

<img src="images/anfs.jpg" alt="anfs" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>As a result of the whole and half steps aligning, the relative minor can always be identified as the 6th note of the major scale.</p>


 <p>Thats all for now. Stay tuned.</p>
