	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Music Theory</p>

	<p>To understand music theory we first have to understand that:</p>

	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2em;"><strong>✨ Music is just nice sounds. ✨</strong></p>

	<p>Everything in music essentially comes back to the fact that music sounds good. No matter how complicated it may seem, music is about creativity and feeling. If it sounds good, you’re doing something right.</p>
	
<p>This leads into the first proper lesson.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">


<p id="sound" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Sound & Pitch</p>

<p>Sound is made of waves through the air.</p>

	<p>The speed of the wave makes the sound higher or lower. We measure this by the amount of waves per second or “frequency.” This unit of measurement is called <strong>“Hertz”</strong> (hz).</p>

<img src="images/wave.jpg" alt="Wave" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


 <p>We call this <strong>“Pitch”</strong> and for music we have named 12 of these pitches. Despite there being a wide range of frequency we can hear, there is no need to name any more pitches. To explain this further we’ll look at “A”.</p>

 <p>The pitch we hear at 440hz has been called “A.”</p>

 <p>If you divide that by 2 to 220hz our brains also hear “A.”</p>

 <p>So too if you keep halving. So 110hz = “A”, 55hz = “A” and so on.</p>

 <p>This also works when doubling. 880hz = “A”, 1760hz = “A” and so on.</p>

<img src="images/doubling.jpg" alt="doubling" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">
 

<p>So there is no reason to name any more pitches because to our ears they loop back around to the beginning.</p>

<p>The distance between each of these loops is called an <strong>“Octave”</strong> which we have divided into 12 and named these divisions <strong>“Notes”</strong>. The naming system of the notes will be explained over the next few lessons.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="notes" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Notes</p>

 <p>The pitches we learned about previously are more commonly known as <strong>“notes.”</strong> There are 12 notes in total. 7 <strong>natural</strong> notes and 5 <strong>accidentals</strong> (The ones with the # and ♭). This is where the first bit of memorisation comes in.</p> 

<img src="images/notes.jpg" alt="notes" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


<p>Each of these notes are the same distance from each other. I will be referring to this distance as a <strong>“half step.”</strong></p> 

<p>You’ll notice that some of the notes have 2 names; these are commonly referred to as the <strong>“sharps”</strong> (#) or <strong>“flats”</strong> (♭). It should be noted that there is nothing special or different about these notes. Sharp means up a half step, and flat means down a half step.</p>

<img src="images/flatsharp1.jpg" alt="flatsharp1" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Also</p>

<img src="images/flatsharp2.jpg" alt="flatsharp2" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


 <p>It’s simply a naming system to help us not have the same letter notes in our scales.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="scales" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Scales</p> 

<p>It’s not the notes themselves that sound musical, but rather the distance between them. All 12 notes played in sequence (The chromatic scale) doesn’t really make you feel much. So we made more scales with different spacings that have different feelings. We will focus on just 1 for now:</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">The Major scale</p>

 <p>Now we are starting to skip notes. I will be referring to this as a <strong>“whole step”.</strong></p>

<img src="images/wholestep.jpg" alt="wholestep" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

 <p>As said before, <strong>scales are not the notes, they are the steps between them.</strong></p>

<p>So the major scale steps are: Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, and a half step brings us back to the start.</p>

<img src="images/majorscale.jpg" alt="majorscale" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

 <p>You can start this combination of steps on any note and, while it will sound higher or lower, everything else will sound the same.</p>

<img src="images/maj3.jpg" alt="maj3" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  
<strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

<p>I’d encourage you to experiment with this on your instrument. It’s important to see and hear how this works in practice.</p>

</div>

<p>Once you're happy with that it's time to be able to name the notes properly. The naming system will be fully explained in the next section.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="keys" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Keys</p>

<p>When you play a scale the key is named after the starting note (also called the <strong>root note</strong>) and the scale. For example a major scale played starting on A is called A major.</p>

<p>The names of the notes in the key should then follow the A through G format. Whatever key you're playing in should never have 2 of the same letter. This is what decides the name to give our accidentals.</p>

<img src="images/aacc.jpg" alt="aacc" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>There’s an important pattern emerging here. Your key will only have sharps or flats, not both. Also, each key has a different number of accidentals.</p>

<p>When starting your key on an accidental you can choose to call it one or the other, however one is usually less complicated than the other.</p>

<img src="images/abcomp.jpg" alt="abcomp" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>While they are both correct, G# doesn't need to be doing all that. Lets just call that one A♭ and forget about it.</p>

<p> We can then use the number of accidentals to help learn the different keys to play in. This is the reason most music theory lessons start with the key of C major, as it contains no accidentals. I will also be using it in future lessons.</p>

<img src="images/cmaj.jpg" alt="cmaj" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="numeric" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">The Numeric System</p>

<p>Now that we have learned that all our major scales roughly sound the same, we need a system to talk about the notes that can apply to all  keys and by assigning a number instead of a note in between our whole steps and half steps, we can do just that.</p>

<img src="images/numeric.jpg" alt="numeric" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Notice that there are two 1’s. Just like how our notes loop, so do the numbers.</p>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  
<strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

<p>Now I’d encourage you to experiment with this system on your instrument. Make some random number patterns from 1-7 and play them in different keys if you can. (Don’t work too hard)</p>
 
<p>15461, 5463112, 2567321, and so on.</p>

<p>You’ll again notice that while higher or lower, they all sound the same.</p>

<p>Also by making random number patterns, you’re starting to get creative, and hopefully you’ll notice that even with that little bit of creativity things are starting to sound more ✨musical✨</p>

</div>


<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="minor" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">The Minor Scale</p>

<p>It’s time to learn our next scale. The minor scale. Like any other scale it's got its own set of whole and half steps. This time (memorisation time) it's: Whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole.</p>

<img src="images/minorsteps.jpg" alt="minorsteps" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">


<p>This works just like the major scale. You can:</p>

<p> - Start this set of whole and half steps to any note and it will sound the same.</p>
<p> - Name the sharps and flats from A to G with no double letters.</p>
<p> - Assign numerical values to play in different keys.</p>

<p>Now let’s compare the 2 scales. You may recall when I said that different scales have different feelings. It’s often stated that the major scale sounds “happy” and the minor sounds “sad.”</p>

<p>Also like keys, each minor key has different numbers of accidentals. Just like the key of C major, the first minor scale taught is A minor as it has no sharps or flats.</p>

<img src="images/aminor.jpg" alt="aminor" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">
 
<p>Wait a second… Why does A minor have the same notes as C major?</p>

<p>Let’s find out.</p>

<p id="relative" style="text-align:center; font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">Relative Minors</p>

<p>Every major scale has its relative minor. This means that they share the same notes and chords.</p>

<img src="images/cna.jpg" alt="cna" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>It's not just C major and A minor that have this relationship. Remember that every major scale has the same order of steps and so does every minor scale.</p>

<img src="images/anfs.jpg" alt="anfs" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>As a result of the whole and half steps aligning, the relative minor can always be identified as the 6th note of the major scale.</p>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="intervals" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Intervals</p>

<p>When you hear a piece of music, unless you have perfect pitch, it is not possible to identify the key or exact notes being played by ear alone. What we can identify is the distance or “intervals” between the notes.</p>

<p>By this point you have already learned a bit about intervals. Whole steps and half steps are intervals, and when you number the 7 notes in your scale they are all intervals, but I have to get a bit technical here.</p>

<img src="images/intervals.jpg" alt="intervals" style="display:block; max-width:50%; height:auto; margin:1rem auto;">

<p>These are proper names of the intervals. Remember that all our notes are a half step apart so our intervals are measured in half steps.</p>

<p>There is no need to memorise all that right now. Whether you're working in a major scale or minor scale it's fine to just call them first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and octave.</p>

<p>What will be important in the next lesson are the <strong>major and minor thirds</strong>, and the <strong>perfect fifth</strong>, which I will just be calling the <strong>fifth</strong>.</p>

 <p>Also a half step and a minor second are the same thing. A whole step and a major second are the same thing. There's more than one name for everything so don't worry about it.</p>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  
<strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

<p>It's not just the names of these intervals that are worth learning. The sound of the intervals is the important part, and it is possible to train your ear to hear them better.</p>

<p>Ear training is a subject for another day but right now I would encourage you as you learn both theory and your instrument to pay attention to the intervals as you learn and you will notice improvement with time.</p>

</div>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="chords" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Chords</p>

<p>Like the scales, chords are movable patterns of whole steps and half steps. However this time the notes are played simultaneously (in <strong>harmony</strong>).</p>

<p>Just like the scales there are different chords that evoke different feelings. We will be focusing on and comparing the 2 main types of chords. The <strong>major chord</strong> and the <strong>minor chord</strong>.</p>

<p>The major chord is made from the <strong>root, major third and perfect fifth</strong>.</p>

<img src="images/mchord.jpg" alt="mchord" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>The minor chord is made from the <strong>root, minor third and perfect fifth</strong>.</p>

<img src="images/minchord.jpg" alt="minchord" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Notice how the only difference between the notes of the chords is the third. The sound and feeling of the chords are also different. It is said that the major chord sounds happy and the minor sounds sad.</p>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  
<strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

<p>This is another important lesson to experiment with on your instrument. Try making some chords and move them around. Try changing a major chord to minor and vice versa. Pay attention to how they sound and make you feel.</p>

</div>

<hr style="margin:2rem 0; border:none; border-top:1px solid #ccc;">

<p id="chordkey" style="text-align:center; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold;">Chords in a key</p>

<p>To make this simpler we will just be focusing on the major scale to begin with.</p>

<p>There are 7 chords for each of the 7 notes in the major scale. Unfortunately it's not as simple as saying major scale = major chord. We have to <strong>build our chords from the notes available in the scale</strong> which changes things.</p>

<p>The following diagrams will be in the key of C major but the rules will apply to all major keys.</p> 

<p>Let's start by numbering our notes and selecting the 1 (Root), 3 (Third) and 5 (Fifth).</p>

<img src="images/cnum.jpg" alt="cnum" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Now let's count the half steps between the notes and name the intervals.</p>

<img src="images/cmajch.jpg" alt="cmajch" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Ok. We have the root, major third and fifth. We know that one! It's a major chord :) In this case, a C major chord.</p>

<p>Now let's do that with the 2nd note in the scale and see what happens. Remember we only use the notes in the key, this means the 2nd note becomes our root and we count the third and fifth from there.</p>

<img src="images/dnum.jpg" alt="dnum" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Now let’s count the half steps and name the intervals.</p>

<img src="images/dmin.jpg" alt="dmin" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Oh this time it's the root, minor third and fifth. That’s a minor chord. In this case a D minor chord.</p>

<p>We do this for every note in the scale and end up with a pattern of major and minor chords.</p>

<p>There's also the Trey Smith of chords. The diminished chord. This chord has a minor third and <strong>diminished fifth</strong>. This means the fifth has one less half step than a perfect fifth. It’s the last chord of the major scale but it is hardly ever used so there's no need to go into further depth right now.</p>

<p>Every major scale follows this pattern of major minor and diminished chords so this is another one to memorise:</p>

<p><strong>Major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished.</strong></p>

<img src="images/chordkey.jpg" alt="chordkey" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
  
<strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

 <p>This is another important lesson to experiment with on your instrument. Just like we did with the notes in the scale, make some random combinations of chords (or <strong>chord progressions</strong>). This time as we aren’t worrying about the 7th chord, try choosing a key, and choose some numbers from 1-6 and play the corresponding chords.</p>

</div>











<p style="text-align:center; font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">Chords in a minor key</p>

<p>To find the chords in the minor key exactly the same way. By <strong>building our chords from the notes available in the key.</strong></p> 

<p>This gives us another pattern to memorise:</p>

<p><strong>Minor, diminished, major, minor, minor, major, major.</strong></p>

<img src="images/chordkeymin.jpg" alt="chordkeymin" style="display:block; max-width:100%; height:auto; margin:1rem 0;">

<p>Just like how the relative minor has the same notes as the relative major, it also has the same chords. Notice how the notes line up and so does the pattern of majors, minors and diminished chords.</p>





<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">

  <strong style="display: block; font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exercise</strong>

<p>Now I’d encourage you to practice this on your instrument again but with a bit of a twist. This might seem a bit complicated but I have given you all the information you need.</p>

<p>Let’s stick with C major, and make a chord progression starting and ending on C as our 1 chord. Lets try 1,4,5,1.</p>

<p>How does that sound? Now let’s swap the 1 with 6. So 6,4,5,6.</p>

<p>Sounds different right? This is the difference between the major and  relative minor key. By starting and landing on the minor chord it gives it a different feel. You could say that the 2nd chord progression is in A minor and number it 1,6,7,1.</p>

<p>Before we go into our last chapter I want to take a moment to make sure you are ready.</p>

<p>I have done my best to explain everything in as simple and few words as possible but it is important that you fully understand each chapter so far. This means aside from what I have said needed to be memorised, you can use the information practically with little thought.</p>

<p>If you need to do further research elsewhere then I wholeheartedly encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>Depending on your instrument some lessons will be easier to implement than others, but they are all equally important to your overall understanding of music theory as a whole. None of the information has been instrument specific because music isn't instrument specific. In fact I believe one goal you should have in mind as you learn an instrument isn’t just to play that instrument, but to play music.</p>

<p>Play a different instrument to your own and see how much of your knowledge you can apply to it.</p>
