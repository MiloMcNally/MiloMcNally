    <h1>Music Theory</h1>

    <p>To understand music theory we first have to understand that:</p>

    <p>✨ Music is just nice sounds. ✨</p>

    <p>Everything in music essentially comes back to the fact that music sounds good. No matter how complicated it may seem, music is about creativity and feeling. If it sounds good, you’re doing something right.</p>

    <p>This leads into the first proper lesson.</p>

    <h2>Sound &amp; Pitch</h2>

    <p>Sound is made of waves through the air. The speed of the wave makes the sound higher or lower. We measure this by the amount of waves per second or “frequency.” This unit of measurement is called “Hertz” (hz).</p>

    <p>We call this “Pitch” and for music we have named 12 of these pitches. Despite there being a wide range of frequency we can hear. There is no need to name any more pitches. To explain this further we’ll look at “A”.</p>

    <p>The pitch we hear at 440hz has been called “A.”</p>

    <p>If you divide that by 2 to 220hz our brains also hear “A.” So too if you keep halving. So 110hz = “A”, 55hz = “A” and so on.</p>

    <p>This also works when doubling. 880hz = “A”, 1760hz = “A” and so on.</p>

    <p>So there is no reason to name any more pitches because to our ears they loop back around to the beginning.</p>

    <p>The distance between each of these loops is called an “Octave” which we have divided into 12 and named these divisions “Notes”. To understand the naming system of the notes we have to move to our next lesson.</p>
